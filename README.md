# STUDDyGLUcoz
This is an Android App, completely written in Java, targeting students all over the world, to help in proper GOAL SETTING and to MOTIVATE students to rise above from their failures. This app will take all course details of the current semester/year as input, divide it into modules, create a daily schedule of study and notify the user about the dayâ€™s target at the study time. This app also blocks social media apps from sending notifications during the study period. It also creates effective revision schedules. On completion of a course, it takes feedback (such as common mistakes, weightage of topics in exams, etc.) for the future students taking on the same course.

It was built under the mentorship provided by Microsoft, as a part of Codess, 2018.
